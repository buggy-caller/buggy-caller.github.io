A bug-riddled frontend for a rudimentary conferencing client, used as an educational tool to help students try their hands at a bit of debugging. This was adapted from an interview tool, used with permission.

If you are a student currently doing this exercise, this repo does *not* contain a list of all the bugs, but good work coming to check!
